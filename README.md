# etch-a-sketch
My second project within Odin. JavaScript + CSS + HTML fundamentals practice within this one


Goals here: 

Create functional etch-a-sketch (combination between sketchpad and etch a sketch)

Use Odin's guide and learned lessons so far to implement the functionality for the sketchpad

Research as much as I can on options on how to implement this project

=============FINAL UPDATE======================


This project has been finished and pushed onto my GitHub repo: https://github.com/smasher421/etch-a-sketch

This was a milestone project for me. I learned different ways on how to implement and plan ahead. I found the best solution would be to first use all I know so far, but resort to StackOverflow or coding tutorials later as this project required far more implication and knowledge than what Odin first teaches you until this point. That was the purpose, though.

I learned:
-how to integrate JS and manipulate the DOM into a fully-sized project
-how to create a working sketchPad with hover actions, onclick actions, divs and functions
-how to create a function for everything as it eases lizibility and functionality
-how to set conditions for my input sizes, square sizes etc
-how to research and most importantly how to plan out the beginning of a project
