# etch-a-sketch
My second project within Odin. JavaScript + CSS + HTML fundamentals practice within this one


Goals here: 

Create functional etch-a-sketch (combination between sketchpad and etch a sketch)

Use Odin's guide and learned lessons so far to implement the functionality for the sketchpad

Research as much as I can on options on how to implement this project
